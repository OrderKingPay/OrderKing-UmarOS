# Order King Core – Architecture

## Purpose
HDmaster is the single Integration Core + Admin Command Center for the entire Order King platform.

## Principles

1. One canonical order
2. One canonical payment record
3. One immutable financial ledger (append-only)
4. One canonical restaurant, rider, and customer identity
5. Money always in integer paise
6. Strong state machines for orders, restaurants, riders
7. Organization-scoped multi-tenancy
8. Audit logs are never updated or deleted
9. SIMULATED/SANDBOX data is never treated as LIVE

## Order Status Flow (Core)

PENDING → CONFIRMED → PREPARING → READY → RIDER_ASSIGNED → PICKED_UP → ON_THE_WAY → ARRIVING → DELIVERED

Terminal states include: CANCELLED, PAYMENT_FAILED, RESTAURANT_REJECTED, DELIVERY_FAILED, REFUNDED, etc.

## Data Modes
- SIMULATED (development/demo)
- SANDBOX
- LIVE

## Key Folders

- `src/lib/orderking/` → Domain logic (internal compatibility path)
- `migrations/` → Database schema
- `src/routes/` → App routes + API

## Frontend Apps (Consumers of this Core)

- Customers
- Partners (Restaurants)
- Riders

Partner, Customer and Rider windows adapt to the canonical HDmaster order contract; they must not create a second authoritative LIVE order state.

This core must remain stable and correct. All other apps depend on it.
